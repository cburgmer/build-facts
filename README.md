# Build facts

Download build facts from different CI/CD servers in a standard JSON schema.
You then take it from there with your own analytics.

    $ curl -LO https://github.com/cburgmer/build-facts/releases/download/0.5.4/build-facts-0.5.4-standalone.jar
    $ java -jar build-facts-0.5.4-standalone.jar jenkins http://localhost:8080
    Finding all builds for syncing from http://localhost:8080 (starting from 2021-01-06T23:00:00.000Z)...

    {"jobName":"Test","buildId":"2","start":1615151342348,"end":1615151344854,"outcome":"pass","inputs":[{"revision":"9bb731de4f4372a8c3b4e53e7d70cd729b32419c","sourceId":"https://github.com/cburgmer/buildviz.git"}]}

    [...]

## Why?

It's hard to innovate when every build server has their own format of reporting
build data. By offering a more standard format, we hope that it becomes
feasible to share build analytics across users of different build servers.
See https://github.com/cburgmer/buildviz for an example on what is possible with
the current set of build properties.

## Features

- Streams standardized build data (specified via JSON Schema)
- Splunk HEC format
- Resume from previous sync
- Output build data to files
